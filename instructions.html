        <h4 class  = "py-5 red"> First, welcome to my first functionally working Trivia Game! The rules to my game are very
            simple and like all the other trivia games. Random Generated questions will pop up on the screen and you
            have an indefinite amount of time to answer the questions. Four different answers will pop up and you will
            click on what your answer will be. If you are in hard/secret mode. Then there will be a timer to keep you on
            your toes, so be sure to answer quick! Also, if you have already played through my game then , make sure to
            find my Easter-egg hidden in the options to main menu screen. Besides from that, Good Luck and May The Greek Gods be in your
            favor. </h4>
